In the ASR task, participants were asked to transcribe automatically Vietnamese audio files into the spoken word sequences. The committee provided the test set only, while the training data for the acoustic and language models was developed by the teams themselves.

The test set was composed of 796 continuous wav files of news speech for a total duration of two hours, without any information on the sentence segmentation. The speech was recorded in a non-noisy environment, and available in three dialects: Northern, Southern and Central with respectively proportion of 50%, 40% and 10%.
